# Fluent numbers

Tired of plain, old numbers in you code?  
Hate the way your IDE highlights numbers and want them go away?  
Ever dreamt of writing several lines of code instead of few numbers?  

### How does it work?

The boring way :'(
```
long value = 1964;
```

The exciting way!
```
long value = Numbers.positive().one().nine().six().four().create();
```

### Requirements

Java 8 or higher

### The future

- Basic arithmetic operations
- And more!
